# Gas Leakage Monitoring And Alerting System for Industries

# Team ID - PNT2022TMID19226

## **About :**

> ##### Gas leakage is the main problem of the industrial sectors working with highly inflammable gases. Gas Leakage fires took an increasing toll on lives and property in recent years. The leakage of gases only can be detected by human nearby and if there are no human nearby, it cannot be detected. But sometimes it cannot be detected by human who has a low sense of smell. Therefore, in such cases Industries are in need of a Gas Leakage Detection System for gas leakage identification and to perform certain measures in order to reduce the impact incase of any fire and to alert people/workers about the gas leakage.

# Python Script for Gas Leakage Monitoring System Simulation

## **Python Simulation -** [Python Code](https://github.com/IBM-EPBL/IBM-Project-5462-1658765976/tree/main/Develop%20Python%20Script)

### Steps to Use the simulation

#### Install the required python packages mentioned in the requirements.txt

> pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Start the application

##### Type the following command in the terminal

> python PNT2022TMID19226_Python_Code.py

##### OR

##### Double Click the python file

> PNT2022TMID19226_Python_Code.py

### Note

- Tkinter Python GUI is used to set the **Gas level**, **Temperature level** and **Humidity level**.
- The data is sent to IBM IoT Watson Platform and rendered to dashboard using Node-RED.
